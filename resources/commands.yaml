    Is not a command itself but may replace a parameter of most other commands. Replaces the old RANDOM() command. It draws at random one value or number from up to eight parameters.
    The command shouldn't be used in multiplayer maps, as it will lead to synchronization problems. Value represented by DRAWFROM is selected at start of a map, and never changes during the gameplay.
